	libid3tag-0.15.1b-utf16.patch - handle bad utf16 length

Patches only in this version:
	allow-id-space.patch - Allow parsing of tags with spaces in the frame ID (iTunes).
	read-no-seek.patch   - Adds read mode ID3_FILE_MODE_READONLY_NOSEEK which does not seek,
                           useful for parsing ID3 tags in non-MP3 files where they are not
                           located at the start of the file.
	seek-after-fdopen.patch - PerlIO buffering can cause the file pointer to be wrong after an fdopen,
                              this patch calls seek after fdopen.
	itunes-non-syncsafe.patch - If we read an invalid v2.4 frame length, assume it was written by iTunes
                                and treat it as a non-syncsafe integer.
	translate-pic.patch  - v2.2 PIC frame has a 3-byte field that isn't compatible with APIC, causing parsing
                           to fail.
    v2.3-xsop.patch - support experimental ID3v2.3 XSOP tag.
    utf16-le-default.patch - Bug 14728, default UTF-16 byte order to LE when no BOM is present.
    debug-trace.patch - Enable trace debug output
    parse-partial.patch - Bug 14705, if we find a bad frame, return frames we've parsed so far instead of
                          ignoring the whole tag.
    public-file-api.patch - Allow use of filetag and id3_file types.
