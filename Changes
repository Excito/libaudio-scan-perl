Revision history for Audio::Scan

0.45    2009-10-26 15:00:00
        - Bug 8380, Read multiple ID3 tags when more than one is found
          in a file, such as ID3v1 + ID3v2.
        - Fixed MP3 find_frame when looking for audio_offset + 1 and
          a Xing TOC is present.  Xing TOC is ignored for this special
          case.
        - Fixed FLAC find_frame when file has ID3v2 tags.
        - Bug 14883, added audio_size info to WAV and AIFF.
        - Fixed crash on invalid FLAC picture block.
        - Fixed bug in Ogg bitrate calculation.
        - Fixed tests to work on old Perls without Encode.
        - Max buffer size got accidentally reset to 10M in 0.44.
        - Added utility methods: get_types, extensions_for, type_for (Frank Terbeck)

0.44    2009-10-16 22:00:00
        - Bug 14788, ASF: Fixed crasher when reading multiple integer tags.
        - Changed Newx/Newxz calls to use older New/Newz API to support older Perls.

0.43    2009-10-16 15:00:00
        - Increase max buffer size yet again (to 20MB), this time someone had 16MB
          of artwork!
        - libid3tag: Don't re-generate frametype.c, compat.c, and genre.dat as this
          can fail if gperf is not available.

0.42    2009-10-13 10:45:00
        - Bug 14728, fixed issue in libid3tag where default ID3v2.3 UTF-16 byte
          order was set to big-endian instead of little-endian when no BOM
          was present.  Several other tag readers also default to little-endian
          so this appears to be the de-facto standard, even though the v2.3 spec
          says all Unicode text must have a BOM.
        - Bug 14705, Fixed libid3tag to return frames parsed so far when it runs into
          an invalid frame.
        - Bug 14658, MP4: fixed signed char issue on some PPC platforms.

0.41    2009-10-12 10:30:00
        - FLAC: Re-factored FLAC code to remove libFLAC dependency.
        - FLAC: API change: more accurate seeking via find_frame, which
          now takes an offset in milliseconds instead of bytes and seeks
          to the correct audio frame containing the desired sample.
        - FLAC: Added support for reading ID3v2 tags.
        - AIFF: Fixed error when reading ID3 chunks with a bad chunk size.
        - MP4: Fixed parsing of files with short TRKN fields.
        - MP4: Parse audio object type from esds box.
        - Vorbis: Added file_size to info.

0.40    2009-10-03 16:00:00
        - Bug 14462, fixed reading of WAV files with 18-byte fmt chunks.
        - WAV: Fixed reading of files with data chunks having the wrong size.
        - MP4: Fixed parsing of tags with duplicate keys containing integer
          values.
        
0.39    2009-10-01 16:00:00
        - Bug 14241, fixed Win32 crash when using find_frame on FLAC files.
        - Bug 14476, fixed crash when very large artwork is present (now supports
          tags up to 10M).
        - MP4: Fixed handling of cover art when multiple covers are present. Currently
          only the first cover image is returned.
        - Added is_supported($path) method. Can be used to determine if a given
          file can be scanned. (Frank Terbeck)

0.36    2009-09-18 23:30:00
        - Bug 13449, changed the way MP3 average bitrate calculation works. Read
          bitrate of all frames starting from the beginning of the file, bail out
          early if the file appears to be CBR.
        - Fixed a few bugs in the buffering code.
